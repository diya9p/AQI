OVERVIEW
    This project aims to analyze the temporal impact of air pollutants on disease and mortality rates across various states and union territories in India. Utilizing AI and ML techniques, the project investigates the correlation between air quality indices (AQI) and health outcomes over time.

FEATURES
- Data Collection: The dataset comprises 350x16 data points, including parameters such as state/UT, year, population statistics, AQI, specific pollutants (SO2, NO2, PM10, PM2.5), and     health statistics (total cases, deaths).
- Data Modeling: Applying various data modeling techniques to understand the relationships between air quality and health outcomes.
- Visualization: Visual representation of the data to highlight trends and insights.
- Predictive Analysis: Utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict future trends and impacts based on historical data.
